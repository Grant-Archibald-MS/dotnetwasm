# Power Platform Component Framework and .NET Web Assembly

Hey there! Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of the Power Platform Component Framework (PCF) and .NET Web Assembly. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just curious about these technologies, this article will give you a friendly overview of what they are and how they work together. Let's get started!

## What is .NET Web Assembly?

First things first, let's talk about .NET Web Assembly. In simple terms, Web Assembly (often abbreviated as WASM) is a binary instruction format that allows code to run in web browsers at near-native speed. It's like having the power of a desktop application right in your browser! With .NET Web Assembly, you can write your code in C# or other .NET languages and run it directly in the browser. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for web development.

## Experimental Support for Browsers in .NET 9.0

Exciting news! .NET 9.0 introduces experimental support for running .NET code directly in the browser using Web Assembly. This means you can leverage your existing .NET skills to build rich, interactive web applications without relying on JavaScript. It's still in the experimental phase, but it's a promising step towards more seamless web development experiences.

## What is Power Apps Component Framework?

Now, let's shift gears and talk about the [Power Apps Component Framework (PCF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/component-framework/overview). PCF is a powerful framework that allows developers to create custom components for Power Apps. These components can be used to extend the functionality of Power Apps, providing a more tailored and interactive user experience. Think of it as a way to supercharge your Power Apps with custom controls and features.

## Options to Get Additional Resources into a PCF Component

When building PCF components, you might need to bring in additional resources. Here are a couple of options:

1. [**Web API**](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/component-framework/reference/webapi): You can use Web APIs to connect your PCF components to external data sources, such as Dataverse. This allows your components to fetch and display data dynamically.
2. [**Web Resources**](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/web-resources): Another option is to use web resources, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, to enhance your PCF components. These resources can be stored within your Power Apps environment and referenced by your components.

## What Types of Resources Can Be Included in a PCF Control?

PCF controls can include a variety of resources to enhance their functionality and appearance. Some common types of resources are:

- **JSON**: For data configuration and storage.
- **CSS**: To style your components and make them look great.
- **TypeScript**: To add interactivity and logic to your components.

## Deployment Process to Create and Publish a Package

Deploying a PCF component involves a few key steps:

1. **Develop**: Build your component using the PCF CLI and your preferred development tools.
2. **Package**: Package your component into a solution file.
3. **Publish**: Import the solution file into your Power Apps environment and publish it.

## ALM Process to Deploy PCF Components as Part of a Solution

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is crucial for managing your PCF components. Here's a simplified ALM process:

1. **Source Control**: Store your component code in a version control system like Git.
2. **Build**: Use automated build tools to compile and package your component.
3. **Deploy**: Deploy your component to different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) using deployment pipelines.

## Pros and Cons of Web Resources vs. Web API

When it comes to storing Web Assembly components, you have a few options. Let's weigh the pros and cons:

| **Option**          | **Pros**                                      | **Cons**                                      |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Web Resources**   | - Easy to manage within the Power Apps environment.<br>- No external dependencies. <br>- Existing CSP process | - Limited storage capacity.<br>- May impact performance if not optimized. |
| **Web API and IndexedDB** | - Can handle larger data sets.<br>- More flexible and scalable. <br>- Take advantage of Datavesre Security Model for Assemblies | - Requires additional setup and configuration. <br>- Address differences when compare to CSP of web resources |

## Impact of CSP and Updates

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an important consideration when working with Web Assembly and PCF components. CSP helps protect your application from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by specifying which resources are allowed to be loaded. Make sure to configure your CSP settings correctly to avoid any security issues.
### Use Hashes from Manifests

Generate cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-256) for each assembly file.
Store these hashes in a manifest file inside the PCF control.
When loading assemblies from WebApi, compare the hash of the loaded file with the hash in the manifest to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.

### Digital Signatures:

Sign the assemblies with a digital signature.
Verify the signature before loading the assembly to ensure it comes from a trusted source.

### Content Security Policy (CSP) with Nonce

Although CSP might be limited, you can still use nonces for scripts included in the PCF controls to add an extra layer of security.

### Regular Audits and Monitoring

Regularly audit the contents of WebApi store values.
Implement monitoring to detect any unauthorized changes to the stored assemblies.
